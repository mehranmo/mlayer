# Examples

This folder contains example scripts demonstrating how data can be annotated with
M-layer style identifiers and converted between different units. The examples
are provided as both a Python script and a Jupyter notebook.

- `conversion_examples.py` – runnable Python script with a `demo()` function
  showing conversions for energy, length, temperature, pressure, velocity and
  mass fraction.
- `conversion_examples.ipynb` – notebook version of the same examples.

The examples use simple conversion factors and are intended for demonstration
only. They do not query the actual M-layer register.
